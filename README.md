In this example, we create a Calculator class that inherits from tk.Tk, which is the main window class in the Tkinter library. The __init__ method sets up the window properties, such as its title and size, and calls the create_widgets method to create the buttons and display.

The create_widgets method creates the display using an tk.Entry widget, and calls the create_button method to create the buttons for each of the numbers, operators, and other functions.

The click method is called whenever a button is clicked and performs the appropriate action based on the text of the button
